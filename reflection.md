Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Association` affectes your programming?
Association makes a program much easier to use because you can break it down into simpler, smaller parts.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I could make ASCII art for the different parts but I could not figure out how to fully resize the banner display that could fit a message input by the user. I would advise somone taking this course in the future to start this assignment early in order to fully utilise tutoring and office hours.
